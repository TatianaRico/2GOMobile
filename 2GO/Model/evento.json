Premetto che Stefano Zaini non è un nostro inserzionista (e credo che non lo sia stato mai se non episodicamente) ne gli devo qualcosa e tantomeno lui la deve a me/noi (inteso come rivista SUONO) e che, infine, i prodotti da lui trattati e promossi “anche” tramite la mostra appaiono raramente su SUONO essendo il focus della rivista orientato differentemente. Ciò non ha impedito che lui si avvicinasse a noi e noi a lui con il comune intento di promuovere e fa prosperare (sebbene al momento questo appaia difficile dato le condizioni economiche globali) un evento che ormai a buon diritto fa parte della storia dell’alta fedeltà italiana come il Milano Hi-Fidelity e tutti gli altri X..

In the words of JENNIFER WISE of RAWKIN REVIEWS: “If you are an EAGLES fan, this is definitely the experience you want to be a part of. This band is a Texas favorite who’s fan base is steadily growing. It was standing room only in the GRANADA THEATER and these guys played the music like they wrote it! Playing all their top hits and fans favorites such as “ALREADY GONE”, “HOTEL CALIFORNIA”, and “NEW KID IN TOWN”. DESPERADO brings to the table what others lack, Talent... And lots of it.”\n\n\nGET VIP CONCERT SEATING: Enjoy a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night concert in style at Legacy Hall with your very own reserved area. Email VIP@legacyfoodhall.com for reservations and pricing.
